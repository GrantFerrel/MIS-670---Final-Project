# MIS-670---Final-Project
Home Depot Regionalized Marketing &amp; Business Campaign

As we welcome in a new era of marketing, many companies (Netflix, target, Amazon for example) are exploring a new frontier of providing extremely personalized ads targeted at individual consumers based on purchasing history and location. This project aims to analyze online comments (via twitter and review pages) along with the current events news to develop the most effective marketing strategy based on region. 

*Note: Considering the time frame for this project, I will only be focusing on a marketing campeign specifically targeting Kansas Home Depot customers. This approach can then be expanded to account for the entire US for real world application.*
