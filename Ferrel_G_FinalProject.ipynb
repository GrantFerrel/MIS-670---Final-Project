The hardware holding the microwave in the cabinet over the range was stripped, causing a potential of the microwave falling. The refrigerator had the water line kinked in the back of the refrigerator causing the refrigerator to malfunction. After numerous service calls, this was finally discovered. The dishwasher was set to start automatically when it was installed causing us to struggle to figure out how to stop it, and that caused it to lock making it inoperable with a full load of dirty dishes. There have been about 10 service calls overall since November causing us to take off of work for their 4 hour window. The last service call, after waiting 5 hours and calling twice to check on the technician, was a no-show. No apologies from them. Today, they came to replace the defective refrigerator. They sent a team from the store to pick up the old refrigerator. They arrived without tools, and scratched our hardwood floor very badly. We asked them to put something down to protect the floor, and they refused. When I called the assistant manager at the store, he said all he could do was file an insurance claim. This is such a nightmare. Now I have to deal with an insurance company on my floor. Very poor customer service, and no responsibility for their actions.\\n        ]</td>\n",

    "Based on our sentiment analysis of the tweets collected via twitter, we can conclude that the overall sentiment is pretty neutral. However, this is only half the story. After careful review of the overal tweet sentiment, we find that a substantial number of the tweets are centered around the HomeDepot \"RetoolYourSchool\" promotion. This generates what I would consider more of an \"artificial\" review system since the users are being economically incentivied to promote the company retweeting a single positive tweet. This is a brilliant marketing tactic to flood twitter with positive sentiment regarding the company... but it makes our sentiment analysis incredibly biased in actually determining how the customers actually feel about the company.

       " '\\n            We purchased a suite of 4 appliances in November. 3 of them were installed incorrectly. The hardware holding the microwave in the cabinet over the range was stripped, causing a potential of the microwave falling. The refrigerator had the water line kinked in the back of the refrigerator causing the refrigerator to malfunction. After numerous service calls, this was finally discovered. The dishwasher was set to start automatically when it was installed causing us to struggle to figure out how to stop it, and that caused it to lock making it inoperable with a full load of dirty dishes. There have been about 10 service calls overall since November causing us to take off of work for their 4 hour window. The last service call, after waiting 5 hours and calling twice to check on the technician, was a no-show. No apologies from them. Today, they came to replace the defective refrigerator. They sent a team from the store to pick up the old refrigerator. They arrived without tools, and scratched our hardwood floor very badly. We asked them to put something down to protect the floor, and they refused. When I called the assistant manager at the store, he said all he could do was file an insurance claim. This is such a nightmare. Now I have to deal with an insurance company on my floor. Very poor customer service, and no responsibility for their actions.\\n        ']"

The largest cluster clearly occuring between topics 4, 7, 18, 19, 3, 2, 16, 9, and 12. Another important trend found in analyzing the topic distribution is that there are a number of words occuring very frequently accross topics. This high frequency words include, \"Delivery\", \"Service\", \"Weeks\", \"Store\", \"Ordered\", etc. "

Presently, all of Homedepot's marketing endevors come directly from the corporate office (Atlanta, Georgia) and don't take customers regional needs into consideration. When applying a broad approach such as that currently in use by the Homedepot, many potential customers can be lost in given the large economic, meteorological, socialogical, and economic differences that occur accross the county... even the state for that matter. Considering this fact, the following analysis aims to help develop an individualized marketing approach for each store in Kansas."

    "As stated in the project overview above, the goal of this project was to analyze online comments (via twitter and review pages) along with the current events news to develop the most effective marketing strategy based on region. After having performed the above analysis, it is my personal opinion that all objectives were satisfactory completed... but as always, additional parameters could be analyized for a more complete real world application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown above in section 5, I completed a sentiment analysis for two different data sets (Twitter and Trustpilot reviews) to generate a more complete understanding of how customers generally feel about Home Depot as a company. Per the analysis results for both, we found that there was a close to a 50/50 split between possitive and negative reviews with very few neutral reviews. While this analysis alone does not provide us with any information for which to make an informed business decision, but it does set the tone for our continued analysis in identifying common trends related to positive and negative reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our topic modeling analysis was completed in section 6 of the above analysis. Firstly, to reiterate that voiced above, only 180 reviews were collected from the trustpilot website which is not nearly as many reviews as I would have liked to have had for consturcting our model... given that the more reviews used in training our model the more accurate it becomes. However, for the purposes of this project I feel it has done the job. When looking at the Intertopic Distance Map the largest cluster clearly occuring between topics 4, 7, 18, 19, 3, 2, 16, 9, and 12. Another important trend found in analyzing the topic distribution is that there are a number of words occuring very frequently accross topics. This high frequency words include, \"Delivery\", \"Service\", \"Weeks\", \"Store\", \"Ordered\", etc. Given that our sentiment analysis produced mixed results its difficult to tell if these words relate to a positive or negative sentiment, but we can conclude that Delivery and Service are amoung some of the most discussed topics and therefore very important to the customer base. Moving forward, Home Depot should stress a high level of dedication to continued improvements in these areas from all of the staff members to ensure a satisfying customer experience. In addition, the company can use this insight to highlight positive examples of customer service and delivery via public platforms for marketing purposes. My suggestion would be to begin using the Home Depot twitter account to pursue this goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, this is the most meaningful section (section 7) of the entire analysis. A significant amount of business insight can be gathered from this section alone. For instance, I first began by web scrapping the KWCH website for all severe weather alerts by county in Kansas. I then merged this pandas data frame with a complete list of Home Depot locations in Kansas to identify only those stores located within the affected county. It is my intention that the company use this information to market \"weather specific\" products that could assist the state inhabitants affected by the storm. To elaborate, each of these stores (on an individual level) could begin marketing items often made more desireable in severe weather conditions... generater, flashlight, batteries, radio, etc. It is my opinion that this tactic will provide a public service that will be appreciated while also increasing calls revenue as individuals prepare for adverse weather conditions in their area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I continued by mining for Kansas census information that would provide meaningful business information such as average household income and population. In viewing this information, we can effectively determine regional sales prices, ideal store locations, anticipate which products will be more successful, and develop an indiviualized marketing strategy. To elaborate, we can increase our total sales revenue by dropping the price in lower income areas and therefore selling more product, while simultaniously increasing the sales price in high income areas. More analysis would be required to maximize the price per region but this provides the basis for those considerations. Also, its interesting to note that the majority of Home Depot stores are located in the top 11 counties based on average income. This certainly makes sense when we consider that in order to maximize revenue our store locations must be availible in locations where the largest proportion of wealth is held. In the event that Home Depot decides to move a larger portion of its business online by closing 'brick and mortar' locations, this can be an important consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas For Continued Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "As Home Depot continues to improve and grow as a business there will always be areas to improve upon its current marketing strategy. While my analysis highlights a number of possible avenues for future development, I unfortunately don't have access to company specific information that could be used at this time. For example, I would like to see Home Depot adopt the \"reward card member\" customer approach already utilized by companines like Dilions, Target, American Eagle, etc. These companies can track all purchases associated with the customers card and then make future purchasing suggestions based on individuals purchasing history. This approach also provides the company with the customers contact information allowing for easier access to distributing individualized marketing material. "
